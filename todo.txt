#feature selection for words and chars separately - too high variance?
#randomized l1 - takes long, could work 
#rfe takes long, could word 
#scaling of hand-crafted features - doesn't really make a difference

# averaging multiple classifiers - no effect?

# kernels! chi2, intersection, cosin - can't get SVC to work - normalization?

n_sentence long -> no insult!

jellyfish features
pca / kmenas features
POS x word features
stemmer

"you are" feature / regexp
collocations


not replacing "_" and "." in training set: 1% difference!
feature: ratio of punctuation characters!


more regexp?
html removal!

3) separate selection
4) new feature selection
5) combination of others
